"""
Craps Pass Line Simulator
- User chooses number of games and a fixed per-game bet.
- Come-out: 7/11 = win; 2/3/12 = loss; else set 'point' and roll until point (win) or 7 (loss).
- Payout model: win => +2*bet (keep bet + equal winnings); loss => -bet.
- Prints per-game outcomes and a final summary.
